# Banned from Glory: Countries Excluded from Rugby World Cup History

While [Rugby World Cup 2027](/tickets) promises to showcase 20 nations competing for glory in [Australia](/venues), the tournament's history includes several controversial exclusions and bans that shaped international rugby.

## South Africa: The Apartheid Ban (1987 & 1991)

The most significant exclusion in Rugby World Cup history was South Africa's ban from the first two tournaments due to apartheid policies.

### The 1987 Exclusion

South Africa, despite being a rugby powerhouse, was excluded from the [inaugural Rugby World Cup](/) in 1987. The international sporting boycott, in place since the 1970s, meant the Springboks couldn't participate in New Zealand and Australia.

### Impact on Rugby

- Deprived the tournament of a major contender
- South African players missed career-defining moments
- Created a 'what if' scenario for 1987 and 1991
- Rugby remained divided until 1992

### The Return in 1995

South Africa's readmission led to:
- Hosting and winning the 1995 World Cup
- Nelson Mandela's iconic jersey moment
- Rugby as a unifying force
- Current status as [three-time champions](/teams/south-africa)

## Spain: The 2023 Eligibility Scandal

### The Controversy

Spain qualified for [Rugby World Cup 2023](/) but was disqualified for fielding an ineligible player, Gavin van den Berg, in qualifying matches.

### The Punishment

- **Deduction:** 10 points for two matches
- **Fine:** £25,000
- **Result:** Romania qualified instead
- **Appeal:** Unsuccessful at all levels

### Long-term Impact

Spain's exclusion means they must rebuild for [2027 qualification](/teams):
- Lost generation of players
- Reduced funding and sponsorship
- Grassroots development setback
- Renewed focus on player eligibility
