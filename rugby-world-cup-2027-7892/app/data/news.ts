# Banned from Glory: Countries Excluded from Rugby World Cup History

While [Rugby World Cup 2027](/tickets) promises to showcase 20 nations competing for glory in [Australia](/venues), the tournament's history includes several controversial exclusions and bans that shaped international rugby.

Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia faced comprehensive sporting bans:
